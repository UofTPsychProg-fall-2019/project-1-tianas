# Tiana Simovic's Project 1 Submission

Here is my experiment code for Project 1. This .ebz file is to be run in Experiment Builder (I believe you'll need the latest version to do so).

Once files have been extracted, makee sure to go to `Experiment > Test Run` to execute the code in dummy mode. 

All stimuli should be included in the library, but if for whatever reason they aren't, I've uploaded the data source (`datasource.xlsx`), audio (`audio`), and stimuli (`objects`) files in this repository.

Please let me know if there are any issues! Thanks!
